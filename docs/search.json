    "text": "Part 1: Oefenweb Data & Basic ggplot\nWe are now going to work with real life Oefenweb data to recreate a plot. We‚Äôll first talk you through how to get the necessary data, and then it is up to you to work some ggplot magic!\nLet‚Äôs get started by ensuring that you have all the packages installed that you will need later on.\n\n#### SET_UP ####\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # set default echo = TRUE for all code blocks\n\nrm(list = ls()) # Remove any existing objects in memory\n\n\n#### REQUIREMENTS ####\n# Install Packages\n# Find everything that the user currently has installed\nall_installed_packages &lt;- installed.packages()[, \"Package\"]\n# Install any missing, but required packages\n# nolint start -- trick to omit some lines from the lintr checker, only if you have a good reason!\nif (!\"tidyverse\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"tidyverse\")}\nif (!\"devtools\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"devtools\")}\nif (!\"oefenwebDatabase\" %in% all_installed_packages) {devtools::install_github(repo = \"Oefenweb/r-database\")}\nif (!\"oefenwebTools\" %in% all_installed_packages) {devtools::install_github(repo = \"Oefenweb/r-tools\")}\nif (!\"jsonlite\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"jsonlite\")}\n# nolint end\n\n# Load Required Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\nlibrary(oefenwebTools)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWe now have everything we need to let our online R Studio environment know how to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with our Data Server. We can connect with the database by using the following code. This creates a connection to the database that is stored in the variable con.\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\ndata &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con,\n                        \"SELECT id, login_count, new_school_id, grade\n                         FROM users\n                         WHERE id IN\n                            (SELECT new_user_id \n                             FROM school_classes_users \n                             WHERE new_school_class_id = 3)\")\n\nFrom this point on, you can use the database connection to retrieve data from the server. What the data actually looks like, and which tables/columns are available can be viewed on the Adminer. Log in with the your Oefenweb username and password, and select oefenweb_nl_app from the databases.\nWe can, for example, use the following SQL statement to retrieve the domains table:\n\n# select all columns (*) from the domains table.\nmy_data_domains &lt;-\n  DBI::dbGetQuery(con, # the connection element to our database\n                  \"SELECT * FROM `domains`\")\n\nYou will receive warnings that let you know how data has been parsed. You can ignore these, or even better suppress them ;)\n\nmy_data_domains &lt;-\n  suppressWarnings(DBI::dbGetQuery(con,\n                                   \"SELECT * FROM `domains`\"))\n\n\nA. Replicate this plot\nNow lets get some item data. In the items table we can find data that contains item information as for example the item question or answer options. We will choose the domain tafels (Multiplication Tables). In the items table we can see that there is no mention of ‚Äútafels‚Äù anywhere, however, each item does have a domain_id listed. If we look in the domains table we just retrieved, we see that tafels has the id ‚Äò59‚Äô. We can use this information to retrieve only the items from the tafels game:\n\nitems &lt;-\n  suppressWarnings(DBI::dbGetQuery(con,\n                                   \"SELECT *\n                                    FROM `items`\n                                    WHERE `domain_id` = '59'\"))\n\nNow we manipulate the data and create some new variables that we will need later on. First we convert the continuous variable maximum_response_in_seconds (the total amount of time allowed per item) and turn it into a categorical factor:\n\nitems$maximum_response_in_seconds &lt;- factor(items$maximum_response_in_seconds,\n                                            levels = c(5, 10, 15, 20),\n                                            labels = c(\"5 seconds\",\n                                                       \"10 seconds\",\n                                                       \"15 seconds\",\n                                                       \"20 seconds\"))\n\nThen, we want to know what the actual answer was to a question. Unfortunately, we store question and answer/answer_options data in the format of a JSON string. We thus need to clean the JSON before we can retrieve the answers:\n\n# Create a new variable where we will store the result\nitems$answer &lt;- numeric(nrow(items))\n\n# Loop over each row to clean the content (you could also use an apply function)\nfor (i in seq_len(nrow(items))) {\n  items$answer[i] &lt;-\n    as.numeric(jsonlite::fromJSON(items$answer_options[i])$answerOptions)\n}\n\nWe now have a column answer that has the cleaned, numeric, outcome for each question/item. We can use this to create another categorical variable:\n\n# Now we determine whether the answer is below or above 50\nitems$answer_result &lt;- items$answer &lt;= 50\n\n# Finally we make answer_result also a categorical factor variable\nitems$answer_result &lt;- factor(items$answer_result, levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n                              labels = c(\"equal to or below 50\", \"above 50\"))\n\nOk, now we are ready to make a plot. We will plot the item deadline (maximum_response_time_in_seconds) on the x-axis and the item difficulty (rating) on the y-axis. We group the items into a group with answer equal to or below 50 and above 50.\nThe assignment is for you to reproduce the following visualization (or make it even better):\n\n\nGrading:\n\nDoes the data show the same pattern? [1.5 pt]\nIs the styling the same? [1.5 pt]\nBONUS: Where there extra features added? [0.5 pt]\nDid the code run? [0.5 pt]\nWere styling issues resolved? (lintr) [0.5 pt]\n\nPlease note that you will only receive bonus points if your extra features are meaningful and improve the visualization. Simply changing colors or themes will not be rewarded, unless you can motivate why your changes are an improvement.\nWhen you are done, please close the connection to the database:\n\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\nB.
