    "text": "For the second and final assignment of the Data Visualization module, the challenge is to transform raw data into a clear and compelling story. Your goal is to design a visualization using the Oefenweb data that highlights meaningful patterns and provides actionable insights. To aid in this, each research question (substantiated below) is accompanied by a code chunk which gives you the relevant data. You are expected to do some data preparation and/or filtering of this data to obtain clean, reliable results. However, you are not expected to query data from other sources in the database, or perform complicated data manipulations to derive a variable ‚Äì focus on using the data given to create a sound data visualization.\n\n\nYou will write the assignment in R Markdown (or Quarto), to produce a report-style document of no more than 1000 words. The final version should be compiled into .html format.\nThe report should be a description of the process that led to your final data visualization. You should include:\n\nAn explanation of your research question and the target audience for your visualization. What did you want to communicate?\nA description of your exploratory process, including at least one exploratory graph. This can be the graph that you created in assignment 1, or an updated one. While this graph is intended to illustrate your thought process, its aesthetic- and communicative quality will not be graded. However, we will grade the quality of the report as a whole, which includes communication about how the exploratory graph helped you to understand the data, and influenced your choices for the final, explanatory, data visualization.\nYour final, explanatory, data visualization. Clearly mark which one of your visualizations this is. Include the visualization, along with an explanation of what it aims to communicate. Importantly, what can you conclude from this visualization? Why is this the best way to communicate this conclusion? How robust are your findings? This should follow logically from the introduction of your report (research question & exploration).\n\n\n\n\nYour chosen research question falls into one of three levels: analytics, inference, or prediction. Each level has different expectations in terms of how the visualization should be constructed and what role statistical modeling plays.\n\n\nAnalytics is about describing and comparing what is happening in the data, often in a way that is directly actionable for a practitioner. At this level, we expect you to create clear, actionable visualizations that are easy to interpret for a practitioner (e.g.¬†a teacher). This should rely less on statistical modeling and more on effective communication of patterns in the data. You do, however, need to make sure that the patterns communicated are reliable.\n\n\n\nInference goes one step further: it aims to explain differences or relationships in the data, often by comparing groups or testing hypotheses. We expect a visualization at this level to be supplemented with statistical tests or models (e.g.¬†significance tests). The visualization should not only show patterns but also provide evidence for why the observed differences matter.\n\n\n\nPrediction focuses on using current information to forecast outcomes. At this level, you should fit and interpret a predictive model (e.g., a linear or logistic regression). The visualization should clearly communicate how well the model performs, what predictors matter, and what can be learned from the model‚Äôs outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several guidelines on workflow which you should follow when collaborating on this project:\n\nComment your code clearly. This not only helps us to understand your process, but your group members to collaborate efficiently.\nUse Git. Set up the project following the instructions in Assignment 1.\nDo not push data to GitHub!\n\n\n\n\nWe would like you to hand in a first draft of your report before Friday, October 10th, 12:00. There are no specific requirements for this draft, nor will you be graded on it. However, you will engage in a peer review session during the class, where you will give and receive feedback on the draft. This is also a Q&A moment, where you can ask questions about your project. Therefore, the more you have worked on your draft, the more you will get out of this session.\n\n\n\nThe final draft of your report and data visualization is due Sunday, October 12th, 23:59. You will hand in the assignment on Canvas and GitHub. Please hand in the following documents:\n\nYour .Rmd file. Here we will check your code styling and documentation. Run lintr beforehand!\nYour .html file. Make sure it renders correctly; we will not compile your .Rmd file ourselves. Here, we will grade your report and visualization. Thus if any components are missing, we will not be able to give you points for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by working with a subset of the data, to get a good idea of the data structure and variables, without running heavy computations. This should make your workflow more efficient. We have provided example R code that shows how to generate a reproducible subset.\nAfter developing your workflow, reflect on the robustness of your analysis. Would your findings change when you rerun the analysis on different data, or under altered conditions? Explain why or why not in your conclusion.\nMake sure to render your final visualization large enough so it is readable in the html.\nConsider the subset of your data that you want to visualize.

    "title": "DV Assignment 2 (Final Project)",
    "section": "Research Questions",
    "text": "Research Questions\n\nRQ1. Which students are on track and which are not?\n\n\nExpand Instructions\n\n\nLevel: Analytics\n\nInstruction: Visualize the progress of the class within the following four Math Garden domains: addition, subtraction, clock reading, and tables. It should be useful for the teacher; they should be able to efficiently derive which students are on track in each game and which are not. For this question, you will only have to look at the class‚Äô progress within domain sessions. You can choose one of two ways to define progress in this context:\n\nPopulation-based approach: In the dataset, there is a variable called new_user_domain_q_score. This is a metric which indicates how the student is performing, relative to the average performance of students within the same age group. For example, a q-score of 400 indicates that a child is performing equal to an average student in grade 4.\nWithin-class approach: In the dataset, there is a variable called new_user_domain_rating. This is the raw ability score of the user within the respective game. Normalize this variable for the class within each game to visualize students‚Äô performance relative to the class average.\n\n\n\nData:\n# Clean Glob Env, load packages and connect to database\nrm(list = ls())\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n# For this RQ, we will visualize the progress of students in class '601481'.\n# Run the following code to retrieve the relevant students' user_id's:\nstudent_ids &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_users\n  WHERE school_class_id = '601481'\",\n  con = con\n) %&gt;%\n  pull(user_id)\n\n# Specify the relevant domains\ndomain_ids &lt;- c(1, 2, 9, 59)\n\n# List student id's and domain id's to use as query parameters\nparams &lt;- list(student_ids, domain_ids)\n\n# Now get the log records (only domain sessions)\nlogs &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_logs\n  WHERE session = 'domain'\n  AND user_id IN ({params[[1]]*})\n  AND domain_id IN ({params[[2]]*})\",\n  con = con,\n  params = params\n)\n\n# Close connection\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about how you will deal with children who have no or little data within a specific domain. (How) will you visualize it? Is it reliable?\nYou do not need to worry about generalizability to other classes. It should be relevant for the teacher to say something about their students‚Äô progress within the current class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRQ2. What are the differences in playing behaviors between students that switch games a lot within a given session, compared to students who don‚Äôt?\n\n\nExpand Instructions\n\n\nLevel: Inference.\nInstruction: For this RQ, you will look at the data from the mot_metrics_sessions table, which contains different metrics computed at the session level that we think might be related to motivation. Importantly, in this table, a session is defined as active if the user plays games in either environment (Math Garden / Language Sea) without stopping for more than 10 minutes. If no new game is started within 10 minutes, the session ends. In other words, each row marks a period of continuous activity in the learning environment for a given player.\nDefine a high vs.¬†low switcher by looking at the variables n_different_games and duration. Now, choose one or more of the following variables to relate to switching behavior:\n\nmean_correct\n\nn_skip\n\nn_soft_quits\n\ndifficulty (or easy_ratio / medium_ratio / hard_ratio)\n\nmean_rt\n\n\n\nData:\n# Clean Glob Env, load packages and connect to database\nrm(list = ls())\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n# For this RQ, it might be wise to start off with a subset of the\n# `mot_metrics_sessions` table. You can run the code below to create a subset:\n\n# First retrieve all unique users in this table.\nunique_users &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT DISTINCT user_id\n  FROM mot_metrics_sessions\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Now we will randomly select 20% of the users\nset.seed(123)\nsample_users &lt;- sample_frac(unique_users, 0.20) %&gt;%\n  pull(user_id)\n\n# Get the `mot_metrics_sessions` data for the users sampled above\nsessions_data &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_sessions\n  WHERE user_id IN ({sample_users*})\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Check if no. of unique users in the data equals the no. of users we sampled\nlength(unique(sessions_data$user_id)) == length(sample_users)\n\n# Remove unnecessary objects\nrm(unique_users, sample_users)\n\n# Close connection\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter defining high/low switchers, it may be useful to look at individual users to get an idea of their playing patterns, before aggregating the data further.\nHow will you filter the data to get reliable estimates of switching tendencies?\nTaking the perspective of the child playing the game, what could be an advantage of switching games often? What could be a disadvantage? Considering this perspective could help formulate your narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRQ3. How does post-error quitting differ between in-school and out-of-school practice? What might moderate these differences?\n\n\nExpand Instructions\n\n\nLevel: Inference\nInstruction: It is possible that students‚Äô motivation differs depending on whether they play in a classroom setting or at home ‚Äì a question which we would like you to explore in the data. One way to operationalize motivation in Prowise Learn is post-error quitting. Post-error quitting refers to whether the game was ended prematurely after an error (post_error_quit). First, define a variable which indicates whether a student is playing in or out of school:\n\nSchool times are between 8:30 and 15.00 on weekdays. Be aware of school holidays! These should be defined as out-of-school.\n\nChoose one or more of the following moderators for your final visualization:\n\ngrade\nAverage new_user_domain_q_score\n\nAverage quit (this would define whether a student generally quits a lot, regardless of errors).\n\n\n\nData:\n# Clean Glob Env, load packages and connect to database\nrm(list = ls())\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n# For this RQ, it might be wise to start off with a subset of the\n# `mot_metrics_logs` table. You can run the code below to create a subset:\n\n# First retrieve all unique users in this table.\n# (We'll only look at data from domain sessions)\nunique_users &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT DISTINCT user_id\n  FROM mot_metrics_logs\n  WHERE session = 'domain'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Now we will randomly select 20% of the users\nset.seed(123)\nsample_users &lt;- sample_frac(unique_users, 0.20) %&gt;%\n  pull(user_id)\n\n# Get the mot_metrics_logs data for the users sampled above\nlogs_data &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_logs\n  WHERE user_id IN ({sample_users*})\n  AND session = 'domain'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Check if no. of unique users in the data equals the no. of users we sampled\nlength(unique(logs_data$user_id)) == length(sample_users)\n\n# Remove unnecessary objects\nrm(unique_users, sample_users)\n\n# Close connection\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have two papers dealing with post-error quitting (although not specifically dealing with this question), read them here and here for inspiration!\nYou can define errors as binary (error or correct) or continuous / categorical (with the variable sequential_errors, which denotes the number of errors made in a row at a given item).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRQ4. Can we predict how long a student will look at feedback from different student characteristics and/or play behavior?\n\n\nExpand Instructions\n\n\nLevel: Prediction\nInstruction: Feedback looking time indicates the time that the feedback was displayed on the screen after a student encountered an error, skipped a response, or had a time-out. Whether or not students engage with the feedback they recieve can serve as important information, both for the developers at Prowise Learn (how do users engage with application features?), and for teachers (how do students engage in their learning process?). Here, you can choose between a number of different variables to add to a regression model:\n\ntype of error (incorrect response, skipped response, time-out response). Factor this variable yourself.\ngrade\ngender\nnew_user_domain_q_score\ndifficulty\nshow_coins\nresponse_time_in_milliseconds\napplication (language vs.¬†math)\n\nYou can be selective or choose all variables. If you choose to omit certain variables, please explain why. If you differentiate between covariates and predictors, please argue your reasoning.\n\n\nData:\n# Clean Glob Env, load packages and connect to database\nrm(list = ls())\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n# For this RQ, it might be wise to start off with a subset of the\n# `mot_metrics_logs` table. You can run the code below to create a subset:\n\n# First retrieve all unique users in this table.\n# (We'll only look at data from domain sessions)\nunique_users &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT DISTINCT user_id\n  FROM mot_metrics_logs\n  WHERE session = 'domain'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Now we will randomly select 20% of the users\nset.seed(123)\nsample_users &lt;- sample_frac(unique_users, 0.20) %&gt;%\n  pull(user_id)\n\n# Get the mot_metrics_logs data for the users sampled above\nlogs_data &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_logs\n  WHERE user_id IN ({sample_users*})\n  AND session = 'domain'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Check if no. of unique users in the data equals the no. of users we sampled\nlength(unique(logs_data$user_id)) == length(sample_users)\n\n# Remove unnecessary objects\nrm(unique_users, sample_users)\n\n\n# The code below adds some variables from the `mot_metrics_domains` and the\n# `mot_metrics_users` tables to the `mot_metrics_logs` data.\n\n# Get mot_metrics_domains table\ndomains &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM mot_metrics_domains\",\n  con = con\n)\n\n# Get mot_metrics_users table (for information on gender)\nusers &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT user_id, gender\n  FROM mot_metrics_users\",\n  con = con\n) %&gt;%\n  # Some users are present more than once in the data due to being part of\n  # multiple school classes. Since we only need gender, remove duplicate rows\n  distinct(user_id, gender) \n\n# Delete correct responses from log records\n# (Because the system automatically moves on to the next item after a correct\n# response, there is no 'feedback looking time'.)\nlogs_data &lt;- logs_data %&gt;%\n  filter(correct_answered == 0) %&gt;%\n  # add variables from domains table\n  left_join(\n    dplyr::select(\n      domains,\n      c(domain_id, short_name, token, app, informative_feedback)\n    ),\n    by = \"domain_id\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # add gender from users table\n  left_join(\n    users, by = \"user_id\"\n  )\n\n# Close connection\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome games have explicit feedback (feedback which gives more information than right or wrong) ‚Äì check this in the variable informative_feedback. Make sure you account for this somehow.\nIt will be useful to start with an exploration about how children look at feedback. How is this variable distributed? Also examine it across games.\nFeedback looking time can be defined in a continuous manner (predicting the time looked at feedback), or categorical (can we differentiate different types of ‚Äòfeedback lookers‚Äô)? Use the results from your exploration to decide which way is most suitable to define feedback looking."

We prefer to change the data instead of changing labels in the plot. If you change the data, the plot and data will resemble each other, hence you can be more certain that you don‚Äôt have errors in your visualization.\n\n# transform variables to suitable types\nitems_logs$response_in_seconds &lt;- items_logs$response_in_milliseconds / 1000\nitems_logs$correct_answered &lt;- as.logical(items_logs$correct_answered)\nitems_logs$question &lt;- factor(items_logs$question)\n\n# make answer column\nitems_logs$given_answer_type &lt;- NA\nfor (i in 1:nrow(items_logs)) {\n  if (items_logs$correct_answered[i]) {\n    items_logs$given_answer_type[i] &lt;- \"correct\"\n  } else {\n    items_logs$given_answer_type[i] &lt;- \"incorrect\"\n    if (items_logs$answer[i] == \"¬ø\") {\n      items_logs$given_answer_type[i] &lt;- \"questionmark\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nitems_logs$given_answer_type &lt;- factor(items_logs$given_answer_type)\n\nBefore we continue we get the grade information from the users table, add this info, do some filtering and change it to a factor:\n\nusers &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT id AS new_user_id, grade\n  FROM users\",\n  con = con\n)\n\nitems_logs &lt;- dplyr::left_join(items_logs, users, by = \"new_user_id\")\n\n# filter (with dplyr) to only work with grade 3 to 8\nitems_logs &lt;- items_logs %&gt;%\n  filter(grade %in% c(3:8)) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame()\n\nitems_logs$grade &lt;- factor(\n  items_logs$grade,\n  levels = c(3:8),\n  labels = paste0(\"Grade \", c(3:8))\n)\n\nNow we can make the first plot. This plot shows us the relation which users (in terms of grade) practice these items. Note that for this plot we don‚Äôt use the geom_histogram function. In this case we first calculate the relative frequencies of the number of responses per grade, for each question. We store this information in a data.frame that we than use for plotting. So first make this data.frame! With geom_col() we than plot the bars.\nLook at this nice trick to add the %-symbol to the labels: scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\")). I used these settings in my rMarkdown code chunk: fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = \"center\"\n\nFor the second plot we look into response times and given answer (correct, incorrect or questionmark). Note that you first have to make a variable with these answers (correct, incorrect, question-mark). I used these settings in my rMarkdown code chunk: fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = \"center\"\n\nFinally we make a plot with text to have some more information in our visualization. I used these settings in my rMarkdown code chunk: fig.height = 2, fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"\n Finally we combine the three plots (one text plot and two figure plots) into one plot by means of the plot_grid function of the cowplot package. This is the visualization that you should replicate in this assignment Part II.\nI used these settings in my rMarkdown code chunk: fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"\n Tips:\n\nOn plot 1 there is text on the third facet which does not use the default font family\n\nTo select nice colors go to http://colorbrewer2.org [or tips on the Data Visualisation slides]\nGoogle (or other search engines) are your best friend, especially on stack overflow there are many questions and answers about ggplot2\n\nPlease note that you will only receive bonus points if your extra features are meaningful and improve the visualization.\nWhen you are done, please close the connection to the database (run this code in the console!):\n\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()\n\n\n\nB. Interactive visualizations with Plotly\nCopy the code below to create a plot showcasing how a given student‚Äôs ability in Multiplication develops during their first 100 interactions with the game.\nNow, your assignment is to:\n\nMake this plot interactive using the the plotly package. Tip: You can use the ggplotly() function to convert a ggplot object to an interactive plotly object.\nAdd a tooltip that displays additional information when you hover over the plot. Customize the tooltip so that it displays the default plot values and additional insights from two other variables (choose yourself). Make sure all of this information is visible when you hover over the plot.\n\nGrading:\n\nDoes the interactive plot work? [1 pt]\nDoes the tooltip clearly display additional (meaningful) information next to the default plot values? [1 pt]\n\nFor this assignment, we will examine how the student with new_user_id = 19872 progresses through the Multiplication game. To do so, we retrieve the student‚Äôs log_records. In the query below, we also obtain additional information about the learning goals associated with the answered items to provide extra context alongside the data stored in the log_records. This is achieved by performing left joins between the log_records tables and two others: items_learning_goals (which links item_id‚Äôs to learning_goal_id‚Äôs) and learning_goals, which provides further details about the learning goals.\n\n# Load Required Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# if you closed your database connection already, connect to the server again:\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n# get the student's log records on the Multiplication game\n# ... and additional info related to the learning goals\nmy_data &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT logs.*,\n          item_lgs.learning_goal_id,\n          lgs.short_name,\n          lgs.description,\n          lgs.position\n  FROM log_records_3 AS logs\n  LEFT JOIN items_learning_goals AS item_lgs ON item_lgs.item_id = logs.item_id\n  LEFT JOIN learning_goals AS lgs ON lgs.id = item_lgs.learning_goal_id\n  WHERE new_user_id = '19872'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\nWe are now ready to make the ggplot for this assignment. In this plot, we visualize how the student‚Äôs new_user_domain_rating changes as the student plays within the Multiplication game. We also add an color aesthetic to the plot that indicates for each answered item to which learning goal it belongs.\n\n# plot the student's rating development over time\nmy_plot &lt;- my_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = new_user_domain_modified_count,\n      y = new_user_domain_rating,\n      color = reorder(short_name, position) # order by \"position\" variable\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 3,\n    alpha = .5\n  ) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(\n    title = paste0(\n      \"Development of user \",\n      unique(my_data$new_user_id),\n      \"'s ability in Multiplication\"\n    ),\n    x = \"Play count\",\n    y = \"User domain rating\",\n    color = \"Learning goal\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      face = \"bold\",\n      size = 14\n    )\n  )\n\nprint(my_plot)\n\nNow it‚Äôs your turn! Turn this static ggplot into an interactive plotly object, and add a customized tooltip that shows additional context next to the default values when you hover over the plot.\nWhen you are done, please close the connection to the database (run this code in the console!):\n\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()"

    "text": "Part 2: Start on Final DV Project (Group)\n\nA. Specify your research question\nIn class 1 you indicated your preference for a research question for the final project, and were assigned a group to work with. Together with your group, read the instructions for your assigned research question in Assignment 2 again.\n\nDoes your project take an analytical, inference, or predictive approach? Is it clear what is expected in the final data visualization with regards to the approach?\n\nWho is your target audience? How might this influence choices for your final visualization?\n\n\n\nB. Connect to Git and load data\nFor this project, you will collaborate using Git. Connect your server environment to Git by following these instructions: Connecting RStudio Server to Git.\nOne person should download the template R project folder and create a new GitHub repository for your group. Add the documents inside the template folder to the repository. If this is done correctly, the resulting repository should have the following folder structure:\nyour-project-name/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-project-name.Rproj\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/\n|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 00-load-data.R\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ report/\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DV-Assignment2-GroupX.Rmd\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DV-Assignment2-GroupX.html\nThe other group members can then clone this repository to their server environment. Make a first commit and push it. Check that the other group members can pull these changes. If this works, you should be properly set up to work together using Git!\nFeel free to add folders or files within the repository if necessary. Make sure that you maintain the structure such that you follow a reproducible workflow. Additionally, it is important that you never push data to GitHub. If you have to store data, do this in a separate folder outside of your Git repository. Your .gitignore file should already contain the following lines:\n# Ignore data files\ndata/\n*.rds\n*.RDS\n*.RData\n*.rdata\n*.csv\n*.tsv\n*.xlsx\n*.rda\nThis should prevent you from accidentally pushing data files to GitHub. Still, be mindful not to add any data files to your project repository.\nNow, load in the necessary data for your visualization. The code for this is available in Assignment 2. Use the script 00-load-data.R in the code/ folder to load in the data. Examine the data. Discuss with your group:\n\nWhat is the structure of the data?\n\nWhat are the main variables? Can you already make some exploratory plots to understand these variables better?\n\nWhat data cleaning steps are necessary? Do you, for example, need to filter out some observations to obtain reliable results?\n\n\n\nC. Make your first visualization\nFor this assignment you can make any visualization about the chosen theme of the final project with these minimal requirements:\n\nuse multiple plots\nchange the theme (you can use a default theme or create your own)\nuse a good color-scheme, for example colorblind proof\nhighlight some interesting data points, for example using color or text\n\nInclude a description of what you want to communicate, and how you did that. Really work towards making a data visualization that highlights or substantiates a single conclusion. This plot does not have to be the plot for your final project (it probably is not), but use this assignment to get feedback from us on your current ideas.\nGrading:\n\nAesthetics\n\nIs the plot legible? [1pt]\nDo the colors add to the interpretability? [1pt]\nIs the plot simple? [0.5 pt]\n\nCommunication\n\nIs it clear what the plots tries to communicate? [1pt]\nDoes the plot communicate the described conclusions/description? [1pt]\nThe plot requires minimal explanation [0.5 pt]\n\nCreative/complexity\n\nIs the plot creative? [0.5 pt]\nIs the plot/analysis complex? [0.5 pt]\n\n\nClearly state your group members in your document. And please make sure ONE team member submits the assignment on behalf of the group."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this tutorial, we will learn how to work on the Oefenweb server. The server contains real data from Prowise Learn, which you can use to create visualizations. You will need to connect properly to the server in order to access the data and complete the assignments in the Data Visualization modules.\n\nStep 1: Connect to the server\nYou will have signed the GDPR form, and received log-in credentials for the server in an earlier module of this course. Use the same credentials to log in to the data visualization server: https://data-visualization.oefenweb.nl/rstudio/auth-sign-in.\n\nSetup your environment\nWhen working with RMarkdown, start with a setup chunk. This allows you to change settings for all code chunks in your document. Any chunk settings you set here can be overridden in individual chunks later on. It is also good practice to clear your environment at the start of your script, to avoid any conflicts with existing objects in memory.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # set default echo = TRUE for all code blocks\n\nrm(list = ls()) # Remove any existing objects in memory\n\n\n\nInstall necessary packages\nLet‚Äôs get started by ensuring that you have all the packages installed that you will need later on.\n\n# Install Packages\n# Find everything that the user currently has installed\nall_installed_packages &lt;- installed.packages()[, \"Package\"]\n# Install any missing, but required packages\n# nolint start -- trick to omit some lines from the lintr checker, only if you have a good reason!\nif (!\"tidyverse\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"tidyverse\")}\nif (!\"devtools\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"devtools\")}\nif (!\"oefenwebDatabase\" %in% all_installed_packages) {devtools::install_github(repo = \"Oefenweb/r-database\")}\nif (!\"oefenwebTools\" %in% all_installed_packages) {devtools::install_github(repo = \"Oefenweb/r-tools\")}\nif (!\"jsonlite\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"jsonlite\")}\nif (!\"ggplot2\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"ggplot2\")}\nif (!\"cowplot\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"cowplot\")}\nif (!\"viridis\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"viridis\")}\nif (!\"plotly\" %in% all_installed_packages) {install.packages(\"plotly\")}\n# nolint end\n\n# Load Required Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(oefenwebDatabase)\nlibrary(oefenwebTools)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\nMake a connection to the server\nWe now have everything we need to let our online R Studio environment know how to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with our Data Server. We can connect with the database by using the following code. This creates a connection to the database that is stored in the variable con.\n\ncon &lt;- oefenwebDatabase::connect()\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Retrieve data from the server\n\nRetrieve data with an SQL query\nFrom this point on, you can use the database connection to retrieve data from the server. What the data actually looks like, and which tables/columns are available can be viewed on the Adminer. Log in with the your Oefenweb username and password, and select oefenweb_nl_app from the databases.\nWe can, for example, use the following SQL statement to retrieve the domains table:\n\n# select all columns (*) from the domains table.\nmy_data_domains &lt;-\n  DBI::dbGetQuery(con, # the connection element to our database\n                  \"SELECT * FROM `domains`\")\n\nYou will receive warnings that let you know how data has been parsed. You can ignore these, or even better suppress them ;)\n\nmy_data_domains &lt;-\n  suppressWarnings(DBI::dbGetQuery(con,\n                                   \"SELECT * FROM `domains`\"))\n\nRecently, we updated the oefenwebDatabase package with a new function: get_query(). This function automatically suppresses SQL warnings and uses glue_sql() for safe SQL injections (rather than relying on paste() or paste0()). Retrieving data with get_query() looks like this:\n\n# select all columns (*) from the domains table.\nmy_data_domains &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT * FROM `domains`\",\n  con = con # the connection element to our database\n)\n\nThe params argument can be used to specify certain parameters that you want to call within your SQL statement (with {params[[i]]} or {params[[j]]*}):\n\n# specify SQL parameters in 'params' list\ndomain_group_ids &lt;- c(1, 2, 5)\napplication_id &lt;- 1\nparams &lt;- list(domain_group_ids, application_id)\n\n# select all columns from the domains table for domains 1:4\nmy_data_domains &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM `domains`\n  WHERE `domain_group_id` IN ({params[[1]]*})\n  AND `application_id` = ({params[[2]]})\",\n  con = con,\n  params = params\n)\n\nBelow an example of a nested query:\n\ndata &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT `id`, `login_count`, `new_school_id`, `grade`\n  FROM `users`\n  WHERE `id` IN\n    (SELECT `new_user_id`\n    FROM `school_classes_users`\n    WHERE `new_school_class_id` = '3')\",\n  con = con\n)\n\nNow lets get some item data. In the items table we can find data that contains item information as for example the item question or answer options. We will choose the domain tafels (Multiplication Tables). In the items table we can see that there is no mention of ‚Äútafels‚Äù anywhere, however, each item does have a domain_id listed. If we look in the domains table we just retrieved, we see that tafels has the id ‚Äò59‚Äô. We can use this information to retrieve only the items from the tafels game:\n\nitems &lt;- get_query(\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM `items`\n  WHERE `domain_id` = '59'\",\n  con = con\n)\n\nFor a review of SQL queries, see the SQL Handout from the previous module.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Manipulate the data\nNow we manipulate the data and create some new variables that we will need later on. First we convert the continuous variable maximum_response_in_seconds (the total amount of time allowed per item) and turn it into a categorical factor:\n\nitems$maximum_response_in_seconds &lt;- factor(items$maximum_response_in_seconds,\n                                            levels = c(5, 10, 15, 20),\n                                            labels = c(\"5 seconds\",\n                                                       \"10 seconds\",\n                                                       \"15 seconds\",\n                                                       \"20 seconds\"))\n\nThen, we want to know what the actual answer was to a question. Unfortunately, we store question and answer/answer_options data in the format of a JSON string. We thus need to clean the JSON before we can retrieve the answers:\n\n# Create a new variable where we will store the result\nitems$answer &lt;- numeric(nrow(items))\n\n# Loop over each row to clean the content (you could also use an apply function)\nfor (i in seq_len(nrow(items))) {\n  items$answer[i] &lt;-\n    as.numeric(jsonlite::fromJSON(items$answer_options[i])$answerOptions)\n}\n\nWe now have a column answer that has the cleaned, numeric, outcome for each question/item. We can use this to create another categorical variable:\n\n# Now we determine whether the answer is below or above 50\nitems$answer_result &lt;- items$answer &lt;= 50\n\n# Finally we make answer_result also a categorical factor variable\nitems$answer_result &lt;- factor(items$answer_result, levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n                              labels = c(\"equal to or below 50\", \"above 50\"))\n\n\n\nStep 4: Make a visualization\nOk, now we are ready to make a plot. We will plot the item deadline (maximum_response_time_in_seconds) on the x-axis and the item difficulty (rating) on the y-axis. We group the items into a group with answer equal to or below 50 and above 50.\n\nggplot(data = items,\n       aes(x = maximum_response_in_seconds,\n           y = rating,\n           fill = answer_result)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Available Response Time\",\n       y = \"Item Rating/Difficulty\",\n       fill = \"Item Answer\")\n\n\n\nStep 5: Disconnect from the server\nWhen you are done working on the server, you need to disconnect from the database. You do this with the following code:\n\noefenwebDatabase::close_connections()"

We can now clone your assigned GitHub group repository into your RStudio account.\n\n\nStep 2: Adding git-tracked R projects\n\nGo to your group‚Äôs GitHub repository and click on the green &lt;&gt; Code button. Choose to clone the repository via SSH and copy the code:\n\n\n\n\nSSH Key\n\n\n\nNow go back to RStudio. On the top right (sort of cubical icon) you can find a project overview Project: (none). Make sure this is in fact set to no project, if you see the name of a different repository/project, click it and select close project.\nMake a new R project for your group assignment: click on New project &gt; Clone Git Repository. Add the code you just copied from GitHub to Repository URL and create the project (the Project directory name will automatically be created for you).\n\n\n\n\nSSH Key\n\n\nIt will now appear as if your RStudio is re-starting; don‚Äôt be feared, this is what is supposed to be happening.
